This document is meant serve as a baseline for creating Secure Software Development Lifecycle
curriculum within any organization.

It includes some core curriculum that help developers understand how to think securely when
implementing features. It also includes examples of the kind of exploits that can occur when
certain precautions aren't taken.

By reading to the end of this Gitbook, you will be able to:
* describe the most common security headers in the HTTP protocol and when they're necessary
* identify, exploit, and prevent the most common classes of web application vulnerabilities
* identify the risks of secrets in code and version control
* adopt a 'security-first' mentality when creating software
* conduct basic security audits by indentifying insecure code

On the [Github repo](https://github.com/audibleblink/sdlc), where this Gitbook is maintained, there
are interactive labs that can be deployed and consumers of this curriculum can then carry out some
of the attacks outlined here.

This should be considered a living document and Pull Requests are most welcome.
