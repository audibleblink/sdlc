This document is meant serve as a baseline for creating Secure Software Development Lifecycle
curriculum within any organization.

It includes some core curriculum that help developers understand how to think securely when
implementing features. It also includes examples of the kind of exploitation that can occur when
certain precautions aren't taken.

On the Github repo where this Gitbook is maintained, there are interactive labs that can be
deployed and consumers of this curriculum can carry out some of the attacks outlined in this
curriculum.

This should be considered a living document and Pull Requests are most welcome.
